From a professional standpoint they know the ins and outs of investment banking recruiting and will put you in a position to succeed in the industry. For me, they did this by refining my professional brandage (emails, resume, behaviorals) and walking me through insane technical questions. Every time we chatted, I came out with a better technical understanding and behavioral acuity. From a mentor standpoint, they’re very chill people to be around and great at communicating how to problem solve for yourself. I can’t recommend Santi and Lucas enough.”</blockquote>

        <blockquote>“Santi and Lucas were both instrumental in my recruiting process. I realized I wanted to pursue investment banking at the start of the fall semester, and so, I felt behind compared to my peers. As a result, I signed up for Santi and Lucas’s mentorship program, which proved to be an invaluable resource. Through countless mock interviews, my behavioral and technical skills progressed immensely. Santi and Lucas were also extremely responsive every time I reached out to them for help or advice.

The recruiting process is different for everyone and difficult to navigate, and so, having two individuals who were extremely successful in their processes provided me with a sense of confidence knowing that they were in my corner to support me. Overall, I would highly recommend Santi and Lucas’s mentorship program as they are both incredible mentors and individuals.”</blockquote>
